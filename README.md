# PROFITABLE-ITEMSET-MINING-USING-WEIGHTED-FP-GROWTH
## 1. INTRODUCTION
Mining frequent patterns or Itemsets is an important issue in
the field of data mining due to its wide applications.
Traditional Itemset mining is, however, done based on
parameters like support and confidence. The most widely
used algorithms to obtain frequent Itemsets are Apriori and
Frequent pattern growth. They are binary in nature. It means
that they only consider whether the product is sold or not. If
the product is sold, then it is considered true and else false.
And these algorithms produce frequent itemsets, which only
consider the occurrence of items but do not reflect any other
factors, such as price or profit. Profitable Itemset Mining has
recently been proposed, in which transactions are attached
with weighted values according to some criteria. It is
important because if support and confidence are only the
parameters assumed, we may miss some of the profitable
patterns.. However, the actual significance of an Itemset
cannot be easily recognized if we do not consider some of
the aspects like quantity and profit per each item.. The
problem of Profitable Itemset mining is to find the complete
